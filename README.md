SkillCraft Technology: Responsive Landing Page üöÄ
This is a responsive landing page built as part of the SkillCraft Technology Internship. The project demonstrates core front-end development skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create an interactive and visually appealing user experience.

‚ú® Features
Responsive Design: The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices, providing an optimal viewing experience.

Fixed Navigation Bar: A fixed header stays visible as the user scrolls, ensuring easy navigation throughout the site.

Scroll & Hover Effects: The navigation bar dynamically changes its style (adds a background blur and color) when the user scrolls past the initial hero section. Navigation links also feature a hover effect with an expanding underline animation.

Smooth Scrolling: Clicking on a navigation link smoothly scrolls the page to the corresponding section.

Mobile Hamburger Menu: On smaller screens, the navigation links collapse into a hamburger menu for a clean and intuitive user interface.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML5: For the semantic structure of the web page.

CSS3: For styling, including responsive design with media queries, transitions, and animations.

JavaScript: For adding interactivity, such as the scroll-based header effect and the mobile menu toggle.
